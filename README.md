# ScriptableObject Container for Unity

The ScriptableObject Container package provides the ability to nest ScriptableObjects and work with them similar to Components.

You add a ScriptableObject to another ScriptableObject Container in a similar way how you add a Component to a GameObject.

On the scripting side, you retrieve ScriptableObjects from the Container similarily to how you retrieve Components from a GameObject:
