# ScriptableObject Container for Unity

The ScriptableObject Container package provides the ability to nest ScriptableObjects and work with them similar to Components.

You add a ScriptableObject to another ScriptableObject Container in a similar way how you add a Component to a GameObject.

On the scripting side, you retrieve ScriptableObjects from the Container similarily to how you retrieve Components from a GameObject:

# Installation

As of Unity 2019.3, Unity supports to add packages from git through the Package Manager window. 
In Unity's Package Manager, choose "Add package from git URL" and insert one of the Package URL's you can find below.

# Credits

If this package is useful to you, I would appreciate if you mention my name in your credits screen.
Something like "ScriptableObject Container by Peter Schraut" or "Thanks to Peter Schraut" would be very much appreciated from my side.

You can of course use ScriptableObject Container giving me credit.
I'm a big fan of giving credits where credits are due though :)
